xmapwacom
=========

xmapwacom is a tool for mapping stylus inputs to monitors in X11. It creates a
tray icon with a pop-up menu where output monitors can be selected for every
stylus.

xmapwacom requires Python 2 and pygtk. It also requires xsetwacom to perform
actual operations. As such, it may break whenever xsetwacom changes output
format or in parameters. Please let me know when it does.
